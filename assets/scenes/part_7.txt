You see, I feel like your parents love you and want the best for you. 
You must have done something wrong to warrant such actions from them. 
Why not put away your pride and apologize for hurting them? 
Youâ€™re not a mistake but they see you as one. 
Whose opinion matter most? 
A random stranger on the phone or the people who birthed you?
