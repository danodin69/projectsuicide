No, it's not because I am paid for this. 
I know what's like to be depressed, to be alone with no one to talk to. 
But I promise you can talk to me. I'm here for you. 
It might not seem like I care, but I do. 
The pain in this world scares me sometimes. 
So please, do you want to talk about it? 
I’m not forcing you to though, 
I just feel like you need to let it out..

[____ sobs]— I’m really sorry about how I sounded, truly. 
It’s just so sad when the people closest to you don’t even know you. 
I try to talk to my parents about things but they’re never there to listen. 
They shut me out and call me names instead. They raise hands on me sometimes and tell me how I’d amount to nothing. 
It’s all so frustrating, knowing that it’s the people you love that hurts you the most. I try to bear it sometimes, but it hurts so much. 
Is it a crime to be born? Am I really a mistake?
