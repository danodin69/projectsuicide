That’s not true, of course you're not a mistake. 
I bet you're amazing and I believe in you as you are and you're not alone. 
You’re strong and will get through this. 
Like they say, life create hurdles and put in your path just to groom you. 
You can overcome this, if you believe in yourself. 
Do you believe in yourself? 
You need to be honest with yourself here.

It’s not that I don’t believe in myself, 
it’s that they don’t believe in me. 
I can’t count how many slippers has been thrown at me, 
how many shoes I had to dodge, 
how much tears I shed for breaking a plate or just taking too long doing something. Sometimes they say I’m possessed by an evil spirit and they even called pastors to check on me. 
Do you know how damaging that is? 
Do you have any idea what it did to me? 
I walk with my head bent because I’m scared of being seen. 
I fear everything, everyone. 
Like, what if they see my scars? 
Would they laugh and call me names too?
