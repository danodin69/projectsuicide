I feel I can understand you. 
But, I also want you to know that the resources we have are limited and honestly, 
I wouldn’t want to be a bother to anyone. 
I believe people should work out their issues themselves and if push comes to shove, they find out the hidden parts of themselves. 
It’s not exactly rocket science, 
but I think you understand what I’m trying to say.
